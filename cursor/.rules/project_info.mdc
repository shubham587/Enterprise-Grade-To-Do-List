A modern web application that allows users to **create tasks using natural language input** such as:


The system **automatically parses** the input to extract:
- 📝 Task Name  
- 👤 Assignee  
- 🕒 Due Date and Time  
- ⚡ Priority (defaults to P3 unless specified)

These tasks are then displayed in a **beautiful, editable task board/list UI**, allowing teams to manage tasks efficiently with zero friction.

## 🔧 What We Are Building

We are building a **Natural Language Task Manager** – an intelligent to-do list for individuals and teams that:
- Accepts human-friendly task descriptions
- Converts them into structured, manageable tasks
- Displays them in a polished interface
- Supports editing, organizing, and prioritizing

Think of it as **"Notion + NLP for task entry"** or a **command bar for productivity**, ideal for modern teams.
